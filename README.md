## Project investigating customer journey on datascience365 website. Real Data.

# Problem:
Analyse customer behaviour navigating the website

# Process:
Code the functions for the following metrics:
1. Page count - calculates the number of times each page is found in all user journeys (i.e. top most clicked on pages)
2. Page presence - finds the number of journeys each page is present in, i.e. the most popular pages in all user journeys
3. Page sequence - finds the top consecutive page strings and their count.
i.e. I will consult this metric if Iâ€™m interested in the sequence of n pages that most often show up.
5. Average journey length - calculates the average length of a user's journey in terms of pages, per user session

# Useful insights:
Some things a client may decide to do with these findings:
1. If they have a promotion or something important they want their customers to read, they need to attach it to the top viewed pages.
For example 'Blog', 'About us', 'Upcoming courses' pages, got the least amount of views. So if there's any important information on those pages, it won't be seen by many customers.
2. If the client wants to optimise their website, they can look at the best and worst performing pages and decide whether they want to remove some pages that don't perform well and focus their efforts on those that do.
3. If the client wants to direct the customer to a certain page (e.g.'Checkout'), they can observe how long it takes a customer to get to the Checkout page. Maybe the website is not intuitive enough, so the client may need to spend some time on improving their UX.
